## 3.2 BusinessWorks Apps in TIBCO Cloud Integration ##

In this lab, you'll first connect TIBCO Business Studio™ for BusinessWorks from your workstation to TIBCO Cloud. You'll then import a BusinessWorks project into Business Studio that implements a system API that gets purchase orders from SAP Hana. Finally, you'll push the BusinessWorks app to TIBCO Cloud and test it.
